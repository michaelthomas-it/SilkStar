#### Prompt Sample A 

1. Neural node properties (e.g., excitatory or inhibitory, neurotransmitter types).
2. Connectivity strengths between nodes.
3. Time-dependent external stimuli or inputs.
4. Synaptic plasticity rules.
5. Network topological features (e.g., degree distribution, clustering coefficient).
6. Neurotransmitter diffusion dynamics.
7. Neural firing rates and oscillatory patterns.
8. Neuron membrane potentials.
9. Neurotransmitter release and reuptake kinetics.
10. Spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity.

Utilize this model to perform simulations and analyze how changes in these variables influence network behavior, synchronization, and information processing within the connectome. Provide insights into the emergent properties and dynamics of the simulated neural network, and discuss the potential applications of this model in understanding brain function and disorders."

This prompt challenges researchers to develop a comprehensive mathematical model for studying brain activity at both the node and connectome levels, incorporating various dynamic variables and time-dependent processes. The model's outcomes can help advance our understanding of complex neural network behavior.

**I wanted to emphasize the significance of refining your prompting skills even though I didn't make anything today.**

Here's a step-by-step suggestion:

1. **Dedicate a Specific Area**: In your knowledge system, set aside a dedicated area. This is where you'll save various prompts you've used during work, along with their respective answers.
    
2. **Experiment with Structure**: This repository is crucial for when you want to play around with how you frame your questions. By seeing past prompts, you can identify patterns and improvements.
    
3. **Ask the Model for Feedback**: A unique approach I employ is asking the model to evaluate my prompts. For instance, I'd ask, "How could I have phrased this more efficiently to get the same answer?" This helps refine the prompting technique.
    
4. **Develop a Solid Stack**: Over time, you'll accumulate a robust collection of prompts. These will become your go-to templates, and you'll only need to tweak a few variables to make them suitable for various tasks.
    

Remember, the more you practice and refine, the better and more efficient your prompts will become.
