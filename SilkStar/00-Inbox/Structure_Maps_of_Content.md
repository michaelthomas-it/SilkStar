### Structure: Maps of Content

If this vault serves as my version of [a second brain](https://publish.obsidian.md/kaas-published/0-Slipbox/Building+a+Second+Brain), then [Maps of Content](https://publish.obsidian.md/kaas-published/2-Areas/MOCs/_README) or _MOC's_ are the underlying [synapse](https://publish.obsidian.md/kaas-published/3-Resources/Dictionary/Synapse)'s connecting the neurotransmitters of the brain together to form a complex, structured system.

In other words MOC's serve as structural, index notes that list related [Atomic Notes](https://publish.obsidian.md/kaas-published/0-Slipbox/Atomic+Notes) in a single location.

Utilize [Maps of Content](https://publish.obsidian.md/kaas-published/2-Areas/MOCs/_README) (MOCs) to navigate the vault efficiently:
